 ## Sockets
    
   Having an active connection opened between the client and the server so client can send and receive data. This allows             real-time communication using TCP sockets. This is made possible by Socket.io.

   The client starts by connecting to the server through a socket(maybe also assigned to a specific namespace). Once connections is successful, client and server can emit and listen to events. 

## RESTful

  Using HTTP requests, we can use the respective action to trigger every of these four CRUD operations.    
    <li>POST is used to send data to a serverâ€Šâ€”â€ŠCreate</li>
    <li>GET is used to fetch data from a serverâ€Šâ€”â€ŠRead</li>
    <li>PUT is used to send and update dataâ€Šâ€”â€ŠUpdate</li>
    <li>DELETE is used to delete dataâ€Šâ€”â€ŠDelete  </li>
